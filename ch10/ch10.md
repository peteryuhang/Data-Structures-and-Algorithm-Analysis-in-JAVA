## Greedy Algorithm

- "Take what you can get now" strategy is the source of the name for this class of algorithm
- Virtually all scheduling problems are either NP-complete or are solvable by a greedy algorithm

### Huffman Codes

- If the characters are placed only at the leaves, any sequence of bits can always be decoded unambiguously
- Such an encoding is known as **prefix code**
- The encoding information must be transmitted at the start of the compressed file, since otherwise it will be impossible to decode
- This is a two-pass algorithm, the first pass collects the frequency data and the second pass does the encoding
- If we maintain the trees in a priority queue, ordered by weight, then the running time is `O(ClogC)`, where the `C` is the number of characters
