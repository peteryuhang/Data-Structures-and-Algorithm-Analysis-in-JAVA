## Equivalence Relations

- An equivalence relation is a relation `R` that satisfies three properties
  1. (Reflexive) `a R a` for all `a in S`
  2. (Symmetic) `a R b` if and only if `b R a`
  3. (Transitive) `a R b` and `b R c` implies that `a R c`
- eg. `<=` relationship is not an equivalence relation; **Electrical connectivity** is an equivalence relation
