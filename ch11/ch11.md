## An Unrelated Puzzle

- Sometimes it is easier to solve a problem indirectly than directly

## Binomial Queues

- A binomial queue of N elements can be built by N successive insertions in `O(N)` time
  - An insertion that costs `c` units results in a net increase of `2 - c` trees in the forest
- The state of the data structure at any time is given by a function known as the **potential**
- $ T_actual + Potential = T_amortized $
  - $ T_actual $ varies from operation to operation, $ T_amortized $ is stable
- The amortized running times of insert, deleteMin, and merge are `O(1)`, `O(logN)`, and `O(logN)` respectively, for binomial queues

## Skew Heaps

- We define that a node `p` is **heavy** if the number of descendants of p's right subtree is at least half of the number of descendants of `p`, and **light** otherwise. Note that the number of descendants of a node includes the node itself
- If a heavy node is initially on the right path, then after the merge it must become a light node. We can based on this to prove that the amortized time to merge two skew heaps is `O(logN)`


## Fibonacci Heaps

- Supports all basic heap operations in `O(1)` amortized time, with the exception of delteMin and delte, which take `O(logN)`
- Fibonacci heaps generalize binomial queues by adding 2 new concepts:
  - A different implementation of decreaseKey
  - Lazy merging
- Generally, in the binary heap, we do the percolating for the node which been perform decreaseKey, but this take `O(logN)`. The solution is to cut the heap along the dashed line, thus creating two trees, and then merge the two trees back into one
- To merge two binomial queues, merely concatenate the two lists of binomial trees, creating a new binomial queue. So both merge and insert is lazy and been done in `O(1)`
