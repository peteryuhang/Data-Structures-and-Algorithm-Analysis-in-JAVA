## An Unrelated Puzzle

- Sometimes it is easier to solve a problem indirectly than directly

## Binomial Queues

- A binomial queue of N elements can be built by N successive insertions in `O(N)` time
  - An insertion that costs `c` units results in a net increase of `2 - c` trees in the forest
- The state of the data structure at any time is given by a function known as the **potential**
- $ T_actual + Potential = T_amortized $
  - $ T_actual $ varies from operation to operation, $ T_amortized $ is stable
- The amortized running times of insert, deleteMin, and merge are `O(1)`, `O(logN)`, and `O(logN)` respectively, for binomial queues
